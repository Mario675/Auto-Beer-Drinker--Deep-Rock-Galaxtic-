# Info

1. First, prepare a drink. Then start the program.
2. Line up the cursor with the *top* of the drink `(the foam)`, and activate the program with `Ctrl + J.`
3. If you want to exit the program, press `Alt + Esc`. Or right click the `H` icon on the task tray.

- The program will normally go for `3 loops,` but if you want it to go for more, you can increase the amount of loops inside the script. To run the **scripted version,** you will need `AutoHotkey` installed.

- The amount of loops is according to how many beers you want to drink.

- The program is already set to the leaf lovers special. If you want to change it, you are going to have to open up window spy (A program already bundled with Auto Hot Key), and copy and paste the default coords to the command with the comment `Select Leaf lover`. 

>Why was it set to leaf lovers special?

- Because, as far as i've tested, leaf lovers do not make you fall down and or move the cursor to a difference during the `drunk effect`.

I may or I may not update the program from time to time for upgrades. [Here's the link to the github,](https://github.com/Mario675/Auto-Beer-Drinker--Deep-Rock-Galaxtic-) for easy checking.
